# E09a-First-Person-Character

This exercise was completed for a C220 Game Technology class at Indiana University. The professor provided a mostly blank 3D Godot game template. We implemented a camera, perspective, and collision shapes for a human body. The player moves in all directions using the WASD feature. 

The purpose of this exercise is for you to create a 3D first-person character in Godot. As this is your first 3D project in Godot, we will start slowly, giving you an opportunity to become accustomed to the environment and some of the concepts associate with building a 3D game.
